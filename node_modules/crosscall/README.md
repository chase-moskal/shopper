# crosscall

*postmessage rpc and events across origins*

**`npm install crosscall`**

- **remote procedure calls and events between webpages**  
  even if they are on different origins  

- **crosscall client opens the host page in an iframe or a popup**  
  the host can expose async functionality to the client  
  crosscall mediates the client and host via postmessage  

- [**live demo**](https://chasemoskal.com/crosscall/)

- crosscall shares a similar interface with [renraku](https://github.com/chase-moskal/renraku)

- i'm currently using crosscall a lot in my [authoritarian](https://github.com/chase-moskal/authoritarian-client) project
