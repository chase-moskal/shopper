## üì¶ install and configure shopper with simple html

1. **add `<script>` elements in your html `<head>`**

    ```html
    <xiome-mock></xiome-mock>
    <script type="importmap-shim" src="https://unpkg.com/shopper@0.2.0-dev.12/x/importmap.json"></script>
    <script defer type="module-shim">
      import "xiome/x/xiome-mock.bundle.min.js"
      import "https://unpkg.com/shopper@0.2.0-dev.12/x/shopper.js"
    </script>
    <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/es-module-shims@1.4.6/dist/es-module-shims.js"></script>
    ```

1. **configure shopper with a `<shopper-config>` element**

    also place this in your html `<head>`

    ```html
    <shopper-config
      mock
      base-currency="cad"
      currencies="cad,usd,gbp,eur"
    ></shopper-config>
    ```

    the above config is in `mock` mode, which lets you play around with fake products

    we'll explain how to connect your real store in the next section

1. **place `<shopper-cart>` element somewhere on your page**

    this is all you need

    ```html
    <shopper-cart></shopper-cart>
    ```

    however, optionally, you may wish instead to place the cart inside a menu system (like in the demo)

    ```html
    <xio-menu initially-hidden sticky>
      <xio-menu-item>

        <shopper-button></shopper-button>
        <shopper-cart slot="panel"></shopper-cart>

      </xio-menu-item>
    </xio-menu>
    ```

    also, the cart can take a `checkout-in-same-window` attribute, if you want to avoid a popup during checkout

    ```html
    <shopper-cart checkout-in-same-window></shopper-cart>
    ```

1. **list products for sale**

    list all store products with a collection element and the `all` attribute

    ```html
    <shopper-collection all></shopper-collection>
    ```

    list a single collection. get the `link` by copying and pasting the url from your shopify admin panel

    ```html
    <shopper-collection link="https://dev-bakery.myshopify.com/admin/collections/424441479"></shopper-collection>
    ```

    display a single product for sale

    ```html
    <shopper-product link="https://dev-bakery.myshopify.com/admin/products/10232162183"></shopper-product>
    ```

## üì° connect shopper to your real shopify store

- **replace your `<shopper-config>`**  
    use the example below, but replace `shopify-domain` and `shopify-storefront-access-token` with your own values

    ```html
    <shopper-config
      base-currency="cad"
      currencies="cad,usd,gbp,eur"
      shopify-domain="dev-bakery.myshopify.com"
      shopify-storefront-access-token="5f636be6b04aeb2a7b96fe9306386f25"
    ></shopper-config>
    ```

- **obtain your `shopify-domain` and `shopify-storefront-access-token`**
    - login to your shopify store's admin area
    - copy your `shopify-domain` from your browser address bar's url
    - create a new private app (a connection point for your website)
        1. click on the "apps" section on the left sidebar
        2. click the sneaky "Manage private apps" link
        3. check on the agreements and stuff to enable private apps
        4. click "Create new private app"
        5. enter the app name, and developer email
        6. skip the whole "Admin API" section
        7. enable "Storefront API" and check on all "Read" permissions
        8. save your app
    - copy your app's "Storefront access token" (NOT TO BE CONFUSED with the "API Token") and use this as your `shopify-storefront-access-token`

## üíÖ customize shopper's appearance with css

- **shopper looks very plain and ugly by default**  
    that's because it's designed to be customized.  
    shopper only comes with bare-bones layout styles, so it's as easy as possible to customize to match your store  
- **shopper's web components render to light-dom**  
    this allows complete css customization  
- **basic css knowledge is required for visual customizations**  
    the recommended workflow, is to right-click inspect-element anything you want to customize, look at it's element names and class names, and then write some CSS rules on your page.  
    you have to be a bit of a nerd to get this done.  
    we're open to somebody writing some standard themes so people can avoid this step in the future  

## üë©‚Äçüîß under the hood

- published as an npm package `shopper`
- written in typescript
- es modules
- universally-compatible web components
- only makes network requests to shopify, and to https://www.bankofcanada.ca/ to fetch exchange rates
- saves cart data to `localStorage` to keep track of your cart between page loads
- if you want to support some older browsers, you can improve compatibility by adding these scripts above the others
    ```html
    <script async defer src="https://unpkg.com/sorry-not-sorry"></script>
    <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/whatwg-fetch@3.5.0/dist/fetch.umd.js"></script>
    <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@2.5.0/webcomponents-bundle.js"></script>
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è known deficiencies, limitations, problems, and priorities

- shopper was built quickly. we're open to refactors!
- we should make some example css themes that look good so people don't have to customize the css
- we should publish an optimized rollup build for end-use (not suitable for consumption from apps with their own build)
